# Book-Manager
ðŸ“š Book Manager is a simple MERN-style project built to practice API handling in web development. It demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a Node.js + Express backend and a React frontend. The goal is to understand how frontend and backend interact through RESTful APIs.
