# Book-Manager
📚 Book Manager is a simple MERN-style project built to practice API handling in web development. It demonstrates CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using a Node.js + Express backend and a React frontend. The goal is to understand how frontend and backend interact through RESTful APIs.

# ✨ Features

📖 View all books

➕ Add a new book

📝 Update existing book details

❌ Delete a book

🌐 REST API integration between frontend and backend

⚡ Deployed with Render (Backend) and Vercel (Frontend)

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Fetch API

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Other Tools: CORS, JSON handling

Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)
